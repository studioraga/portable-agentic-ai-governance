# M20 Deployment

Node1 runs `deploy/m20/one_shot_node1.sh <M19-summary> [output]`, signs the final-freeze evidence, and packages verifier-only material. Node2 receives only the verifier archive and runs `deploy/m20/one_shot_node2.sh`. The scripts deploy configuration/evidence only; they do not flash firmware, update the host OS, or contact external services.

## Documentation role

This file is a milestone-specific historical/feature record. For the current repository workflow, use [`../README.md`](../README.md), [`../instruction.md`](../instruction.md), [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md), [`Validation.md`](Validation.md), and [`Milestones.md`](Milestones.md).


### M22 relationship

This document remains authoritative for its historical milestone scope. M22 does not rewrite that milestone; it inventories and maps its reusable controls/evidence into the enterprise-security foundation and records remaining gaps in `governance/enterprise/m22/gap-register.json`. See `docs/M22-CISSP-Enterprise-Security-Control-Foundation.md`.

## M23 relationship

This historical milestone document remains authoritative for its original scope. M23 does not rewrite it; M23 consumes the existing identity/authorization/evidence lineage and adds enterprise federation, strong/phishing-resistant MFA policy, entitlement review, PAM/JIT, break-glass, segregation-of-duties, and Node1/Node2 verifier evidence. See `docs/M23-Enterprise-Identity-MFA-PAM.md`.

## M24 relationship

M24 extends the frozen M23 baseline with deterministic asset inventory/ownership/classification, retention and legal-hold handling, evidence-backed sanitization, default-deny DLP/controlled export, and cryptographic key-lifecycle evidence. This historical document remains authoritative for its original milestone; M24 consumes its reusable evidence but does not rewrite M0-M23 semantics. See `docs/M24-Asset-Security-Data-Protection-Crypto-Lifecycle.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M24.md`, `docs/Deployment-M24.md`, and `docs/Validation-M24.md`. M24 closes only `CISSP-D2-001..003`; M21-dependent Domain-3 platform/hardware-root gaps remain open.

## M25 relationship

M25 extends the frozen M24 baseline with explicit network zones, default-deny micro-segmentation, mTLS workload-identity binding, egress allowlisting, network-detection policy and deterministic firewall evidence. This historical document remains authoritative for its original milestone; M25 consumes reusable evidence without rewriting M0-M24 semantics. See `docs/M25-Zero-Trust-Network-Microsegmentation.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M25.md`, `docs/Deployment-M25.md`, and `docs/Validation-M25.md`. M25 closes the M22 `CISSP-D4-002` engineering gap while physical switch/VLAN enforcement and M26 SOC/DR integration remain environment/future-scope evidence.
## M26 relationship

M26 adds the enterprise operational-security evidence layer for centralized SOC telemetry/correlation, vulnerability-remediation operations, executable incident response, and immutable backup/restore/DR validation. This document retains its original milestone authority; M26 consumes its established controls/evidence without rewriting historical behavior. See `docs/M26-SOC-Vulnerability-Incident-Backup-DR.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M26.md`, `docs/Deployment-M26.md`, and `docs/Validation-M26.md`.

## M27 relationship

M27 adds the Secure SDLC / DevSecOps / AppSec evidence layer on top of the immutable M0–M26 lineage. This document keeps its original milestone authority; M27 consumes its controls/evidence where relevant and does not retroactively rewrite the historical contract. M27 closes the `CISSP-D6-002` control-plane capability gap with default-deny security testing gates and independently verifiable Node1/Node2 evidence. Simulated local penetration-test evidence validates the workflow only and is not a production penetration-test claim.
