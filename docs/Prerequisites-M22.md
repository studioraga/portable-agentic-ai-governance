# M22 Prerequisites

M22 is additive to the M21.1 baseline and requires:

1. Git repository containing commit `ea952069938a6435ccb298f5424bab158197ce05`.
2. Python 3.10 or later.
3. OpenSSL with Ed25519 support.
4. `pytest` for validation (`python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'` recommended).
5. Node1 and Node2 must contain the same M22 source tree for source-digest verification.
6. Node2 must never receive M22 private signing material.

Before starting:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD
git cat-file -e ea952069938a6435ccb298f5424bab158197ce05^{commit}
python3 --version
openssl version
```

Expected parent HEAD before M22 changes: `ea95206...`. M22 development is intentionally allowed with uncommitted changes; do not commit generated `var/m22-*` material.

## M23 relationship

M23 extends the frozen M22 enterprise-security foundation with enterprise human identity, OIDC federation evidence, strong MFA context, phishing-resistant privileged authentication, expiring entitlement review, signed single-use JIT privilege grants, dual-approved break-glass access, segregation of duties, and independent Node1/Node2 verification. The authoritative M23 documents are `docs/M23-Enterprise-Identity-MFA-PAM.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M23.md`, `docs/Deployment-M23.md`, and `docs/Validation-M23.md`. Historical M0-M22 behavior and evidence remain immutable.

## M24 relationship

M24 extends the frozen M23 baseline with deterministic asset inventory/ownership/classification, retention and legal-hold handling, evidence-backed sanitization, default-deny DLP/controlled export, and cryptographic key-lifecycle evidence. This historical document remains authoritative for its original milestone; M24 consumes its reusable evidence but does not rewrite M0-M23 semantics. See `docs/M24-Asset-Security-Data-Protection-Crypto-Lifecycle.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M24.md`, `docs/Deployment-M24.md`, and `docs/Validation-M24.md`. M24 closes only `CISSP-D2-001..003`; M21-dependent Domain-3 platform/hardware-root gaps remain open.

## M25 relationship

M25 extends the frozen M24 baseline with explicit network zones, default-deny micro-segmentation, mTLS workload-identity binding, egress allowlisting, network-detection policy and deterministic firewall evidence. This historical document remains authoritative for its original milestone; M25 consumes reusable evidence without rewriting M0-M24 semantics. See `docs/M25-Zero-Trust-Network-Microsegmentation.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M25.md`, `docs/Deployment-M25.md`, and `docs/Validation-M25.md`. M25 closes the M22 `CISSP-D4-002` engineering gap while physical switch/VLAN enforcement and M26 SOC/DR integration remain environment/future-scope evidence.
## M26 relationship

M26 adds the enterprise operational-security evidence layer for centralized SOC telemetry/correlation, vulnerability-remediation operations, executable incident response, and immutable backup/restore/DR validation. This document retains its original milestone authority; M26 consumes its established controls/evidence without rewriting historical behavior. See `docs/M26-SOC-Vulnerability-Incident-Backup-DR.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M26.md`, `docs/Deployment-M26.md`, and `docs/Validation-M26.md`.

## M27 relationship

M27 adds the Secure SDLC / DevSecOps / AppSec evidence layer on top of the immutable M0–M26 lineage. This document keeps its original milestone authority; M27 consumes its controls/evidence where relevant and does not retroactively rewrite the historical contract. M27 closes the `CISSP-D6-002` control-plane capability gap with default-deny security testing gates and independently verifiable Node1/Node2 evidence. Simulated local penetration-test evidence validates the workflow only and is not a production penetration-test claim.

## M28 relationship

M28 adds authority-bound evidence controls for organizational governance, personnel security/training, physical/environmental security, and business-continuity exercises. This document keeps its original milestone authority; M28 consumes its applicable evidence without rewriting historical M0–M27 claims. Real-world HR/facility/BCP controls require authorized production records—local Python validation proves the evidence contract, signatures, freshness and source binding only.

## M29 relationship

M29 aggregates the signed M21 platform prerequisite and M22–M28 enterprise-security evidence into one cross-domain Node1/Node2 validation package. This historical document remains authoritative for its original milestone; M29 consumes its evidence without rewriting its semantics. M29 distinguishes evidence-integrity success from production readiness and remains fail-closed while M21 platform controls or real M27/M28 production evidence are outstanding. See `docs/M29-Enterprise-Cross-Domain-Node1-Node2-Validation.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M29.md`, `docs/Deployment-M29.md`, and `docs/Validation-M29.md`.
