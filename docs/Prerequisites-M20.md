# M20 Prerequisites

- Frozen M19 source baseline.
- Node1 release authority and Node2 independent verifier.
- For final freeze readiness, signed M19 material must report `validation_mode=LIVE`, `production_validation_complete=true`, and zero failed checks.
- Python environment sufficient to run the repository tests and Ed25519 verification.

## Documentation role

This file is a milestone-specific historical/feature record. For the current repository workflow, use [`../README.md`](../README.md), [`../instruction.md`](../instruction.md), [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md), [`Validation.md`](Validation.md), and [`Milestones.md`](Milestones.md).


### M22 relationship

This document remains authoritative for its historical milestone scope. M22 does not rewrite that milestone; it inventories and maps its reusable controls/evidence into the enterprise-security foundation and records remaining gaps in `governance/enterprise/m22/gap-register.json`. See `docs/M22-CISSP-Enterprise-Security-Control-Foundation.md`.

## M23 relationship

This historical milestone document remains authoritative for its original scope. M23 does not rewrite it; M23 consumes the existing identity/authorization/evidence lineage and adds enterprise federation, strong/phishing-resistant MFA policy, entitlement review, PAM/JIT, break-glass, segregation-of-duties, and Node1/Node2 verifier evidence. See `docs/M23-Enterprise-Identity-MFA-PAM.md`.

## M24 relationship

M24 extends the frozen M23 baseline with deterministic asset inventory/ownership/classification, retention and legal-hold handling, evidence-backed sanitization, default-deny DLP/controlled export, and cryptographic key-lifecycle evidence. This historical document remains authoritative for its original milestone; M24 consumes its reusable evidence but does not rewrite M0-M23 semantics. See `docs/M24-Asset-Security-Data-Protection-Crypto-Lifecycle.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M24.md`, `docs/Deployment-M24.md`, and `docs/Validation-M24.md`. M24 closes only `CISSP-D2-001..003`; M21-dependent Domain-3 platform/hardware-root gaps remain open.
