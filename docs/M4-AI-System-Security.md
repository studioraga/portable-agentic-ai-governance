# Milestone 4 — AI System Security

Milestone 4 introduces deterministic controls for model governance, data provenance, retrieval authorization, embedding security, AI evaluation, and AI-specific threat modeling. It deliberately does **not** introduce autonomous LLM agents or LLM-directed tool execution.

## Security invariants

1. A model is deployable only when its governance record is `approved` and its SHA-256 matches the immutable M3 model lock.
2. Every governed data record carries source, digest, owner, classification, tenant, collection time, and license/consent evidence.
3. Retrieval authorization executes **before** retrieval, defaults to deny, denies cross-tenant access, and enforces classification clearance.
4. Embeddings are tenant-partitioned, provenance-bound, dimension-bounded, and cannot include blocked classifications. Raw source text is not stored in the embedding index by this reference policy.
5. Mandatory deterministic evaluations must pass the configured threshold before production acceptance.
6. The AI threat model must cover prompt injection, sensitive-information disclosure, data/model poisoning, vector/embedding weaknesses, model theft, retrieval bypass, and excessive agency.
7. `llm_agent_autonomy=false` and `llm_tool_execution=false` are mandatory in M4.
8. M4 artifacts are SHA-256 bound in a signed Ed25519 AI-security manifest. Verifier nodes receive the public key only.

## Production boundary

The reference implementation uses deterministic fixtures for model/data/retrieval evaluation so that controls can be validated offline. Production integrations must replace fixture provenance records and evaluation inputs with organization-owned ingestion/catalog/evaluation pipelines while preserving these interfaces and fail-closed invariants.

No model inference SDK, vector database, LLM service, GPU, or embedding runtime is required by M4 itself.

## M12 integration

M12 adds a CRA vulnerability/exploitation-intelligence layer without changing this milestone's authority boundary. M12 consumes existing evidence where relevant, emits signed AEV candidate assessments, and performs no statutory-clock, ENISA-submission, or CRA-conformity side effect.

## M13 integration boundary

M13 adds deterministic CRA Article 14(5) severe-incident classification and a signed statutory-clock evidence layer. It consumes M9 security-event facts and M12 AEV candidate evidence while preserving M11 as the authoritative CRA requirement baseline. M13 records an immutable manufacturer-awareness T0, derives the applicable 24-hour and 72-hour deadlines, derives the AEV final-report deadline from corrective/mitigating-measure availability, and derives the severe-incident final-report deadline as one calendar month after the incident notification. M13 does **not** submit to ENISA/SRP, generate the M14 reporting pack, or make a CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M13-CRA-Incident-Classification-Statutory-Clock.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M13.md`, `docs/Deployment-M13.md`, and `docs/Validation-M13.md`.

## M14 integration — CRA reporting / ENISA SRP evidence pack

M14 consumes the frozen M11 requirement baseline, M12 vulnerability/exploitation intelligence and M13 incident/statutory-clock evidence to build signed Early Warning, 72-hour Notification and Final Report evidence packs. M14 is an internal preparation and verification layer only: it performs no CRA SRP/network submission, makes no conformity claim, preserves Node1 signing authority / Node2 verifier-only separation, and requires an authorised Assigned Representative to complete the current SRP web-interface workflow. See `docs/M14-CRA-Reporting-ENISA-SRP-Evidence-Pack.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M14.md`, `docs/Deployment-M14.md`, and `docs/Validation-M14.md`.

## M15 integration

M15 consumes the existing milestone evidence through the frozen M11–M14 contracts to prepare PSIRT/CVD, component-maintainer coordination, fixed-vulnerability advisory and Article 14(8) user-notification evidence. This document's original milestone authority is unchanged: M15 adds no automatic external dispatch, public disclosure, user notification, maintainer contact, ENISA submission or CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M15-CRA-PSIRT-CVD-User-Notification.md`, `docs/Deployment-M15.md`, and `docs/Validation-M15.md`.

## M16 integration — CRA Secure Update & Product Lifecycle
M16 consumes the existing milestone evidence without rewriting its historical responsibility. It adds support-period/lifecycle evidence, signed secure-update metadata and payload verification, anti-rollback decisions, update-retention/free-update policy checks, and end-of-support notification preparation. M16 keeps host OS/firmware modification and network rollout out of acceptance; see `docs/M16-CRA-Secure-Update-Product-Lifecycle.md`, `docs/Deployment-M16.md`, and `docs/Validation-M16.md`.

## M17 — CRA Annex-I Compliance Evidence integration

M17 consumes the existing M3–M16 security, vulnerability, incident, reporting, PSIRT/CVD and secure-update evidence and binds it to all Annex I Part I/II requirement rows from the frozen M11 CRA matrix. M17 records `EVIDENCED`, `PARTIAL` and `GAP` states with SHA-256 evidence references; it does not mutate M11 requirement status, perform conformity assessment, generate the Annex VII technical file, or claim CRA conformity. See `docs/M17-CRA-Annex-I-Compliance-Evidence.md` and `docs/Validation-M17.md`.

## M18 integration

M18 assembles the CRA Article 31 / Annex VII technical-documentation evidence file from the evidence produced by M3-M17. This document remains an input/reference to that assembly; M18 does not retroactively change this milestone's scope. The M18 technical file is explicitly a draft evidence package: it makes no CRA conformity claim, does not perform a conformity assessment, does not authorize CE marking, and does not fabricate the EU Declaration of Conformity. Product-specific production/security test evidence that remains incomplete is carried forward to M19 as an explicit readiness gap.

## M19 integration — CRA Node1/Node2 Production Validation

M19 consumes this milestone's evidence as part of the heterogeneous Node1/Node2 production-validation chain. The M19 signed validation bundle binds the frozen CRA baselines, checks source/version/platform parity and verifier-key isolation, and supplies a production-evidence candidate for Annex I Part II(3) regular product-security testing. M19 does not rewrite this milestone's historical claims, perform conformity assessment, or make a CRA conformity claim.

## M20 integration

M20 consumes the frozen evidence and controls from this milestone as part of the enterprise one-shot deployment/final-production-freeze chain. It does not rewrite this milestone or imply CRA conformity. Final-freeze readiness requires successful M19 live production validation. The M20 secure-agentic Node1/Node2 demonstration reuses the M10 constrained-authority topology and signed human-disposition model for traceable GenAI/agentic governance.
