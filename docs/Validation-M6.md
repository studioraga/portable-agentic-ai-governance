# M6 validation

Run dependency preflight first, then `scripts/m6/validate_m6_local.sh`. The suite proves the positive read-only path and rejects side-effecting tool requests, catalog path traversal, evidence digest tampering and M5 binding drift. Production acceptance requires `scripts/m6/validate_combined_node.sh` to verify M2+M3+M4+M5+M6 simultaneously.

Manual agent smoke tests use `scripts/m6/run_evidence_analyst.py` with one of the five allowlisted read-only operations.

## M12 integration

Existing milestone validation remains unchanged and must continue to pass. M12 adds its own regression/negative gates in `docs/Validation-M12.md`; the full repository suite is run before M12 acceptance to prove no regression to this milestone.

## M13 integration boundary

M13 adds deterministic CRA Article 14(5) severe-incident classification and a signed statutory-clock evidence layer. It consumes M9 security-event facts and M12 AEV candidate evidence while preserving M11 as the authoritative CRA requirement baseline. M13 records an immutable manufacturer-awareness T0, derives the applicable 24-hour and 72-hour deadlines, derives the AEV final-report deadline from corrective/mitigating-measure availability, and derives the severe-incident final-report deadline as one calendar month after the incident notification. M13 does **not** submit to ENISA/SRP, generate the M14 reporting pack, or make a CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M13-CRA-Incident-Classification-Statutory-Clock.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M13.md`, `docs/Deployment-M13.md`, and `docs/Validation-M13.md`.

## M14 integration — CRA reporting / ENISA SRP evidence pack

M14 consumes the frozen M11 requirement baseline, M12 vulnerability/exploitation intelligence and M13 incident/statutory-clock evidence to build signed Early Warning, 72-hour Notification and Final Report evidence packs. M14 is an internal preparation and verification layer only: it performs no CRA SRP/network submission, makes no conformity claim, preserves Node1 signing authority / Node2 verifier-only separation, and requires an authorised Assigned Representative to complete the current SRP web-interface workflow. See `docs/M14-CRA-Reporting-ENISA-SRP-Evidence-Pack.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M14.md`, `docs/Deployment-M14.md`, and `docs/Validation-M14.md`.
