# M9 deployment

Build on Node1:

```bash
python3 scripts/m9/build_m9_material.py --m8-material var/m8-material --out var/m9-material
./deploy/m9/one_shot_node1.sh var/m8-material var/m9-material
```

Package verifier material:

```bash
./deploy/m9/package_verifier_material.sh var/m9-material ../m9-verifier-material.tar.gz
```

Node2 receives only `security-ops-manifest.json`, its signature, public verification key, and signed policy. `signing-private.pem` must never be transferred.

The M9 deployer preserves `~/.config/portable-ai-governance/m9/runtime/secops` across redeployment so SIEM, incident, containment, recovery and preserved-evidence state remains durable.

Recovery authorization uses a dedicated M9 Ed25519 authority. Node1 retains `recovery-signing-private.pem`; verifier nodes receive only `recovery-signing-public.pem`. Recovery grants are incident/containment/check-digest bound, short-lived and single-use.

## M12 integration

Existing deployment semantics remain intact. M12 uses separate `deploy/m12/` one-shot and verifier packaging scripts; Node1 retains M12 private signing material and Node2 receives verifier-only material.

## M13 integration boundary

M13 adds deterministic CRA Article 14(5) severe-incident classification and a signed statutory-clock evidence layer. It consumes M9 security-event facts and M12 AEV candidate evidence while preserving M11 as the authoritative CRA requirement baseline. M13 records an immutable manufacturer-awareness T0, derives the applicable 24-hour and 72-hour deadlines, derives the AEV final-report deadline from corrective/mitigating-measure availability, and derives the severe-incident final-report deadline as one calendar month after the incident notification. M13 does **not** submit to ENISA/SRP, generate the M14 reporting pack, or make a CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M13-CRA-Incident-Classification-Statutory-Clock.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M13.md`, `docs/Deployment-M13.md`, and `docs/Validation-M13.md`.

## M14 integration — CRA reporting / ENISA SRP evidence pack

M14 consumes the frozen M11 requirement baseline, M12 vulnerability/exploitation intelligence and M13 incident/statutory-clock evidence to build signed Early Warning, 72-hour Notification and Final Report evidence packs. M14 is an internal preparation and verification layer only: it performs no CRA SRP/network submission, makes no conformity claim, preserves Node1 signing authority / Node2 verifier-only separation, and requires an authorised Assigned Representative to complete the current SRP web-interface workflow. See `docs/M14-CRA-Reporting-ENISA-SRP-Evidence-Pack.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M14.md`, `docs/Deployment-M14.md`, and `docs/Validation-M14.md`.

## M15 integration

M15 consumes the existing milestone evidence through the frozen M11–M14 contracts to prepare PSIRT/CVD, component-maintainer coordination, fixed-vulnerability advisory and Article 14(8) user-notification evidence. This document's original milestone authority is unchanged: M15 adds no automatic external dispatch, public disclosure, user notification, maintainer contact, ENISA submission or CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M15-CRA-PSIRT-CVD-User-Notification.md`, `docs/Deployment-M15.md`, and `docs/Validation-M15.md`.
