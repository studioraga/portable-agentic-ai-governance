# Milestone 3 — Supply Chain

Milestone 3 adds deterministic software and AI supply-chain controls on top of the frozen M2 security control plane.

## Trust rule

Agents may recommend artifacts, models, prompts or tools. They never decide whether an artifact is trusted. Promotion and startup rely on deterministic digest, signature, provenance and vulnerability-policy verification.

## Implemented controls

- CycloneDX 1.7 software SBOM generation.
- CycloneDX 1.7 AI/ML BOM generation for locked models.
- SHA-256 locks for models, containers, prompts and tools.
- Container references must be digest pinned using `@sha256:`.
- In-toto Statement v1 with SLSA provenance v1 predicate.
- Ed25519 signing and public-key verification using OpenSSL.
- Vulnerability policy with report freshness, scanner identity, severity and unknown-severity gates.
- Production verifier nodes receive only the public signing key; the private release key remains with the release authority.
- Optional OSV-scanner normalization with `scripts/m3/import_osv_report.py`.
- M3 supply-chain verification can be injected into the M2 production security profile by setting `PAG_SUPPLY_CHAIN_REQUIRED=1`.

## Production boundary

The deterministic implementation is offline-capable. The included `m3-offline-fixture` vulnerability report is test evidence only and is rejected by default by production verification. A real production run must import a scanner report, for example an OSV-Scanner result normalized through `scripts/m3/import_osv_report.py`, or an organization-approved equivalent normalized to the M3 report schema.

For enterprise release signing, Sigstore/Cosign may be layered on top of the same release subjects. The built-in Ed25519 path provides sovereign offline signing/verification and does not claim public transparency-log attestation.

## M3 controls

- `AIS-SBOM-001`
- `AIS-AIBOM-001`
- `AIS-LOCK-001`
- `AIS-PROV-001`
- `AIS-SIG-001`
- `AIS-VULN-001`

## M12 integration

M12 consumes M3 vulnerability/SBOM concepts but adds the missing distinction between vulnerability severity and reliable evidence of active exploitation. M3 release blocking therefore remains separate from M12 AEV candidate classification.

## M13 integration boundary

M13 adds deterministic CRA Article 14(5) severe-incident classification and a signed statutory-clock evidence layer. It consumes M9 security-event facts and M12 AEV candidate evidence while preserving M11 as the authoritative CRA requirement baseline. M13 records an immutable manufacturer-awareness T0, derives the applicable 24-hour and 72-hour deadlines, derives the AEV final-report deadline from corrective/mitigating-measure availability, and derives the severe-incident final-report deadline as one calendar month after the incident notification. M13 does **not** submit to ENISA/SRP, generate the M14 reporting pack, or make a CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M13-CRA-Incident-Classification-Statutory-Clock.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M13.md`, `docs/Deployment-M13.md`, and `docs/Validation-M13.md`.

## M14 integration — CRA reporting / ENISA SRP evidence pack

M14 consumes the frozen M11 requirement baseline, M12 vulnerability/exploitation intelligence and M13 incident/statutory-clock evidence to build signed Early Warning, 72-hour Notification and Final Report evidence packs. M14 is an internal preparation and verification layer only: it performs no CRA SRP/network submission, makes no conformity claim, preserves Node1 signing authority / Node2 verifier-only separation, and requires an authorised Assigned Representative to complete the current SRP web-interface workflow. See `docs/M14-CRA-Reporting-ENISA-SRP-Evidence-Pack.md`, `docs/Prerequisites-M14.md`, `docs/Deployment-M14.md`, and `docs/Validation-M14.md`.

## M15 integration

M15 consumes the existing milestone evidence through the frozen M11–M14 contracts to prepare PSIRT/CVD, component-maintainer coordination, fixed-vulnerability advisory and Article 14(8) user-notification evidence. This document's original milestone authority is unchanged: M15 adds no automatic external dispatch, public disclosure, user notification, maintainer contact, ENISA submission or CRA conformity claim. See `docs/M15-CRA-PSIRT-CVD-User-Notification.md`, `docs/Deployment-M15.md`, and `docs/Validation-M15.md`.

## M16 integration — CRA Secure Update & Product Lifecycle
M16 consumes the existing milestone evidence without rewriting its historical responsibility. It adds support-period/lifecycle evidence, signed secure-update metadata and payload verification, anti-rollback decisions, update-retention/free-update policy checks, and end-of-support notification preparation. M16 keeps host OS/firmware modification and network rollout out of acceptance; see `docs/M16-CRA-Secure-Update-Product-Lifecycle.md`, `docs/Deployment-M16.md`, and `docs/Validation-M16.md`.

## M17 — CRA Annex-I Compliance Evidence integration

M17 consumes the existing M3–M16 security, vulnerability, incident, reporting, PSIRT/CVD and secure-update evidence and binds it to all Annex I Part I/II requirement rows from the frozen M11 CRA matrix. M17 records `EVIDENCED`, `PARTIAL` and `GAP` states with SHA-256 evidence references; it does not mutate M11 requirement status, perform conformity assessment, generate the Annex VII technical file, or claim CRA conformity. See `docs/M17-CRA-Annex-I-Compliance-Evidence.md` and `docs/Validation-M17.md`.

## M18 integration

M18 assembles the CRA Article 31 / Annex VII technical-documentation evidence file from the evidence produced by M3-M17. This document remains an input/reference to that assembly; M18 does not retroactively change this milestone's scope. The M18 technical file is explicitly a draft evidence package: it makes no CRA conformity claim, does not perform a conformity assessment, does not authorize CE marking, and does not fabricate the EU Declaration of Conformity. Product-specific production/security test evidence that remains incomplete is carried forward to M19 as an explicit readiness gap.

## M19 integration — CRA Node1/Node2 Production Validation

M19 consumes this milestone's evidence as part of the heterogeneous Node1/Node2 production-validation chain. The M19 signed validation bundle binds the frozen CRA baselines, checks source/version/platform parity and verifier-key isolation, and supplies a production-evidence candidate for Annex I Part II(3) regular product-security testing. M19 does not rewrite this milestone's historical claims, perform conformity assessment, or make a CRA conformity claim.

## M20 integration

M20 consumes the frozen evidence and controls from this milestone as part of the enterprise one-shot deployment/final-production-freeze chain. It does not rewrite this milestone or imply CRA conformity. Final-freeze readiness requires successful M19 live production validation. The M20 secure-agentic Node1/Node2 demonstration reuses the M10 constrained-authority topology and signed human-disposition model for traceable GenAI/agentic governance.
## M21 integration — Embedded Linux & Platform Security

M21 extends the frozen M0–M20 governance/CRA baseline into demonstrable platform security for BIOS/UEFI, Jetson/embedded boot firmware, BMC/device firmware inventory, firmware signing and anti-rollback, debug restrictions, Linux least privilege and systemd isolation, AppArmor/SELinux capability evidence, TPM/DICE roots of trust, platform threat modeling and CI/CD gates. It is non-destructive: live acceptance observes platform state and uses synthetic firmware for signing/rollback demonstrations; it never burns fuses, enrolls UEFI keys or flashes firmware. See `docs/M21-Embedded-Linux-Platform-Security-Validation.md`.

## Documentation role

This file is a milestone-specific historical/feature record. For the current repository workflow, use [`../README.md`](../README.md), [`../instruction.md`](../instruction.md), [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md), [`Validation.md`](Validation.md), and [`Milestones.md`](Milestones.md).


### M22 relationship

This document remains authoritative for its historical milestone scope. M22 does not rewrite that milestone; it inventories and maps its reusable controls/evidence into the enterprise-security foundation and records remaining gaps in `governance/enterprise/m22/gap-register.json`. See `docs/M22-CISSP-Enterprise-Security-Control-Foundation.md`.

## M23 relationship

This historical milestone document remains authoritative for its original scope. M23 does not rewrite it; M23 consumes the existing identity/authorization/evidence lineage and adds enterprise federation, strong/phishing-resistant MFA policy, entitlement review, PAM/JIT, break-glass, segregation-of-duties, and Node1/Node2 verifier evidence. See `docs/M23-Enterprise-Identity-MFA-PAM.md`.
