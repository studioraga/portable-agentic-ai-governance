# M18 Deployment

## Node1

```bash
./deploy/m18/one_shot_node1.sh "$PWD/var/m18-material"
./scripts/m18/verify_node1.sh "$PWD/var/m18-material"
./deploy/m18/package_verifier_material.sh "$PWD/var/m18-material" "$PWD/var/m18-verifier.tar.gz"
```

## Node2

Verify/extract the verifier archive, then:

```bash
./deploy/m18/one_shot_node2.sh /tmp/m18-verifier/m18-material
./scripts/m18/verify_node2.sh "$HOME/.config/portable-ai-governance/m18"
```

Node2 must never receive `signing-private.pem`.

## M19 integration — CRA Node1/Node2 Production Validation

M19 consumes this milestone's evidence as part of the heterogeneous Node1/Node2 production-validation chain. The M19 signed validation bundle binds the frozen CRA baselines, checks source/version/platform parity and verifier-key isolation, and supplies a production-evidence candidate for Annex I Part II(3) regular product-security testing. M19 does not rewrite this milestone's historical claims, perform conformity assessment, or make a CRA conformity claim.

## M20 integration

M20 consumes the frozen evidence and controls from this milestone as part of the enterprise one-shot deployment/final-production-freeze chain. It does not rewrite this milestone or imply CRA conformity. Final-freeze readiness requires successful M19 live production validation. The M20 secure-agentic Node1/Node2 demonstration reuses the M10 constrained-authority topology and signed human-disposition model for traceable GenAI/agentic governance.

## Documentation role

This file is a milestone-specific historical/feature record. For the current repository workflow, use [`../README.md`](../README.md), [`../instruction.md`](../instruction.md), [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md), [`Validation.md`](Validation.md), and [`Milestones.md`](Milestones.md).


### M22 relationship

This document remains authoritative for its historical milestone scope. M22 does not rewrite that milestone; it inventories and maps its reusable controls/evidence into the enterprise-security foundation and records remaining gaps in `governance/enterprise/m22/gap-register.json`. See `docs/M22-CISSP-Enterprise-Security-Control-Foundation.md`.

## M23 relationship

This historical milestone document remains authoritative for its original scope. M23 does not rewrite it; M23 consumes the existing identity/authorization/evidence lineage and adds enterprise federation, strong/phishing-resistant MFA policy, entitlement review, PAM/JIT, break-glass, segregation-of-duties, and Node1/Node2 verifier evidence. See `docs/M23-Enterprise-Identity-MFA-PAM.md`.
